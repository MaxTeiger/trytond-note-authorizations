- **Note types**: Add an entry point to configure note types. Those types can
  be used when creating a note to give them a type, which allows classifying
  and search of notes.

- **Note authorizations**: Note types can be linked to user groups. This allows
  to partition notes, for instance if they contain data that must not be
  accessible to everybody (confidential information, etc...)
